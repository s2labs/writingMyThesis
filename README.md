# What is this?

This is the support guideline, I (Marc-Oliver Pahl; IMT Atlantique, France; TU MÃ¼nchen, Germany) created over more than 15 years individual teaching.
Its aim is easing the thesis process (Master, Bachelor, PhD) for my students and most importantly, raising the quality of the outcome!

This is a living document, so my team and I add more info from time to time.

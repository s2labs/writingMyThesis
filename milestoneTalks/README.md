# Timing

The theses is a project that you are supposed to manage on your own.
However, we support you with best practices and a lot of input.
For [timing and milestones have a look here](00_timeFocus.md)

# What shall I put into the different milestone reports?

As you have seen in the [timing and milestones document](00_timeFocus.md), the different milestones cover different content.
Consequently, it make sense to introduce different things.

Here are some hints for the three major milestones:

1. [Initial Milestone](01_initialTalk.md)
1. [More info on the Initial Milestone from KTH Stockholm](01a_initialTalkKTH.md)
1. [Intermediate Milestone](02_intermediateTalk.md)
1. [Final Milestone](03_finalTalk.md)

Of course another [big milestone is the document. You find more info here.](../document/README.md)

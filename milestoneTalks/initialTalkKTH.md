# Specification and schedule
Adapted from https://www.kth.se/social/group/examensarbete-vid-cs/page/specification-with-timetable/

You must produce a written specification of the elements that will be completed and a schedule for when they will be done.

The specification should be submitted no later than about two weeks after the degree project has been started.

# Specification
The specification shall contain:

## BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE
* Description of the area within which the degree project is being carried out (e.g. connection to research/development, state-of-the-art, scientific and/or societal interest).
* The advisor's interest. The background of the specific assignment to be conducted.
* Objective. What is the desired outcome (from the advisor's side and from the perspective of the degree project)

## RESEARCH QUESTION & METHOD:
* The QUESTION that will be examined. Formulated as an explicit and evaluable question. (NOT a closed yes/no question!)
* Specified problem definition (e.g. what does the assignment entail and what are the challenges involved?)
* Examination method. Preliminary description of, for example, algorithms that will be tested, data that will be used.
* Expected scientific results. How is the work scientifically relevant and what is the hypothesis being tested? How is this hypothesis being tested?

## EVALUATION & NEWS VALUE
* Evaluation. How is it determined if the objective of the degree project has been fulfilled and if the question has been adequately answered? Preliminary report on the evaluation method, measures and data.
* The work's innovation/news value. Why does someone want to read the finished work? And who are these people?

## PRE-STUDY
* Description of the literature studies. What areas will the literature study focus on? How shall the necessary knowledge on background and state-of-the-art be obtained? What preliminarily important references have been identified?

## CONDITIONS & SCHEDULE
* List of the resources expected to be needed to solve the problem (unless the degree project involves investigating what equipment should be used). This can be technical equipment, but also experiment and interview subjects.
* Defined limitations on what is to be done (so that it is clear what is not included in the degree project)
* Collaboration with the advisor (external supervisor). Describe the way in which the advisor will be involved in the project (e.g. in terms of discussion, implementation, report reading).
* Schedule showing not only the order in which elements will be performed, but also the scope of elements and when they will be performed (calendar week number or date). The schedule should contain clear intermediate goals. (Make a GANTT chart with milestones!)

## Schedule
The schedule is to take into account the weeks you can dedicate full-time to the degree project and the periods you totally or partially devote yourself to other things. 

Remember to set aside enough time for report writing. This tends to take longer than expected. Write aside the other tasks not after!

Circumstances may dictate that you must deviate from the specification/schedule. Such deviations are not at all unusual or remarkable. However, you need to discuss any deviations with the advisor and get them approved.

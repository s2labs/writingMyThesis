# Thesis tipps

## How shall I write?

* Write precise.
* Write concise.
* Write clear.
* Write consistent.

## Which are my goals with the text?

* Present that you know how to work as a computer engineer.
* Present a Problem and the development of your solution for it in a straight forward way.
  * Make your point clear.
  * Justify your statements.
  * Make clear which are your contributions.
  * Name your sources.

## Structure

Try to be as clear as possible in your presentation!
You do not write a novel.
Let the reader always know why you raise an aspect, and how it is relevant for your work.

Your chapters are the vertical structure of your document.
They structure the content in things to handle.

Your research questions are the horizontal structure of your document.
They glue the aspects handled in the different chapters together.
Make this obvious!

Once you know enough about the domain of your thesis and about what you are doing: 

* create the TOC of your thesis
* Put a prioritized list of "must haves" and "nice to haves" into each of the chapters.

## Language

Use the simplest and clearest language possible.
The challenge should be your content and not your language!

* Do not use filler words like “too”, “additionally”, etc.
* Write simple sentences: Subject Predicate Object.
* Do not use unnecessarily complex words.
* Do not write personal judgements like “pretty large“, “huge”, etc.
  * write intersubjectively defined terms, e.g. "20ms delay" instead of "fast"
* The defined article (the) is typically used to refer to things introduced before.
  * Example: There is a red house. THE house ...
  * Otherwise use the undefined article.
  * Usability is important. A person using the system... (NOT: "The person" as there was no person introduced.)

## Citations

*Cite often and correctly*

Use citations. They are good (+)! 
Built upon existing research and technology.
You are not supposed to reinvent the wheel, instead you are supposed to structure a field and present it to your reader in the clearest way possible.

The aim of a citation is to 

* give a proof the things you write about exist,
* refer the reader to places where he could continue reading about the topic in case of further interest.

You cannot just write about something. You are NOT Bruce Schneier where everyone believes that you are the expert writing about something. You need references as proof for your claims.

## Figures

You are expected to draw ALL figures in your document by yourself. Direct copying is considered bad.

However, if it makes sense to cite directly, e.g. if the figure is already exectly showing the aspects you would like to show, you can of course do so. But make sure to credit the source properly.

In most cases when you find another figure well done in one of your sources, you will want to show parts of the figure by redrawing them. In such a case, where you are heavily basing your figure on another figure, cite the source by saying "based on [42]" in the caption.

Using figures from others directly or indirectly without proper attribution is plagiarism and not permitted. Neither in your thesis nor somewhere else.

For related work, e.g. Siemens uses this interface (picture), it is of course okay to show original images. BUT you have to cite correctly by giving the source.

## Self-Containment

*Keep in mind that your reader did not do your thesis but wants to learn what you learned.*

Your targeted audience are fellow students that did not do your thesis. 
So expect only common computer science knowledge.

Introduce all things that go above "common sense" that you need in your thesis.

Introduce *every* acronym at first use!

## Summaries
Start *each* chapter after the introduction and before the conclusion with a summary.

* Sum all relevant *outcome* up.
* Tell the reader your story line of the chapter.

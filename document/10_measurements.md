# When doing measurements

Design your experiment carefully.

* Why do you use this setup?
* Why do you run exactly these tests?
* Which outcome do you expect BEFORE running the experiment?
  * How do you plan to do the evaluation?
  * Can your planned evaluation show your hypothesis?
    * Do you ask the right questions?
    * Do you use the right methods to get answers?

Document your measurement results in a way that the experiment can be reproduced BY OTHERS.
You can find a suitable example by clicking on the measurement results in this paper (the figures).

Here is a technical report on conducting measurements.
It may help you on how to document setups and data collections.

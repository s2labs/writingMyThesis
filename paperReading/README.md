# What for?

This document gives you some guidelines at hand for efficiently reading and annotating papers.

# How to search?

The most important is to use the right keywords.
https://scholar.google.com is a good search engine for research papers.

Mind the sources.
Well-established conferences and authors are preferred.

When you find a nice paper, looking at the group's homepage could be a good idea to find more things.

Put every paper into mendeley.
Do not forget the tags / folders.

Write a few lines to each paper not to forget about it three papers later...

For getting an overview, a mindmap can help!

# How to organize?

You are a member of our mendeley group (if you are not, ask your main advisor for the account!).
We organize all our papers in the mendeley.
It helps us to structure and maintain our body of papers.
It also helps making reference lists for LaTeX!

# How to annotate?

1. Do not mark everything! When you are new to a topic, you may find everything interesting. When you know more about a domain, having everything marked is useless...
2. Use the following color scheme for marking text:
  - <span style="color:red">red = problem the paper tackles</span>
  - <span style="color:green">green = major contribution of the paper</span>
  - <span style="color:orange">yellow = interesting / important</span>
  - <span style="color:pink">pink = sub problem</span>
  - <span style="color:blue">blue = subcontribution / explanation of a contribution</span>
